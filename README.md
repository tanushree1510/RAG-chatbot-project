# RAG Project

## Project Overview
This project implements a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** system for managing domain-specific knowledge. It collects data, converts it into embeddings, stores it in a vector database, and uses semantic search to answer queries with the help of a large language model (LLM).

## Features
- Collects data from multiple sources (PDFs, text, CSVs, etc.)
- Converts data into embeddings for semantic search
- Stores embeddings in a vector database
- Performs semantic search to retrieve relevant information
- Integrates with an LLM to generate answers based on retrieved knowledge
